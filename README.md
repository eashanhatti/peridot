### Introduction

Peridot is a language that allows the compiler backend to be written entirely in userspace. Peridot is split into two languages: one for metaprogramming (the metalanguage) and one for "regular" programming (the object language). The metalanguage is a logic language akin to Î»Prolog, while the object language is a dependently typed functional language akin to Idris and Haskell. Metaprograms deal with compiling and optimizing the second language into a chosen target language - importantly, logic programming allows these metaprograms to be extremely declarative, making compilers and optimizers easy to write. Unlike languages where the backend is built-in to the compiler, optimizations to the object language can be easily added since those optimizations are expressed purely in userspace. Programmers can not only write high-level programs, but also describe how to compile those programs to performant, low-level code.
