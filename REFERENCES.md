This is a list of prior art that have influenced Peridot's design and implementation in major ways.

### Two Level Type Theory and Staging

[Two-Level Type Theory and Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03307.pdf)
> We define and develop two-level type theory (2LTT), a version of Martin-Löf type theory which combines two different type theories.

[Staged](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/staged)
> Experimental staged language with dependent types

[MetaML: Multi-Stage Programming with Explicit Annotations](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.422&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
> We introduce MetaML, a practically-motivated, statically typed multi-stage programming language. MetaML allows the programmer to construct, combine, and execute code fragments in a type-safe manner.

[Generating Mutually Recursive Definitions](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/generating-mutually-recursive-definitions.pdf)
> Currently MetaOCaml can only build recursive groups whose size is hard-coded in the generating program. The general case requires something other than quotation, and seemingly weakens static guarantees on the resulting code. We describe the challenges and propose a new language construct for assuredly generating binding groups of arbitrary size – illustrating with a collection of examples for mutual, n-ary, heterogeneous, value and polymorphic recursion.

[Let(rec) Insertion Without Effects, Lights or Magic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00495.pdf)
> We show how one can understand let insertion, and hence implement it in plain OCaml. We give the first denotational semantics of let(rec)-insertion, which does not rely on any effects at all. The formalization has guided the implementation of let(rec) insertion in the current version of MetaOCaml.

### Contextual Type Theory

[Moebius: Metaprogramming using Contextual Types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08099)
> We describe the foundation of the metaprogramming language, Moebius, which supports the generation of polymorphic code and, more importantly the analysis of polymorphic code via pattern matching.

[Contextual Modal Type Theory](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/tocl07.pdf)
> Contextual modal type theory provides an elegant, uniform foundation for understanding meta-variables and explicit substitutions. We sketch some applications in functional programming and logical frameworks

### Elaboration

[Elaborating dependent (co)pattern matching](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3236770)
> We present an algorithm elaborating definitions by dependent copattern matching to a core language with inductive datatypes, coinductive record types, an identity type, and constants defined by well-typed case trees.

[Elaboration Zoo](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/elaboration-zoo)
> Minimal implementations for dependent type checking and elaboration

### Other

[General Recursion via Coinductive Types](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0505037.pdf)
> To every type A we associate a type of partial elements Aᵛ, coinductively generated by two constructors: the first, ⸢α⸣ just returns an element α: A; the second, ▷x, adds a computation step to a recursive element x: Aᵛ. We show how this simple device is sufficient to formalize all recursive functions between two given types.

### Similar Projects
Projects exploring a similar design space - leveraging the compile time vs runtime separation - but from perspectives other than that of two level type theory.

> Lisp dialect featuring highly flexible syntax, arbitrary compile-time evaluation, and static types!

[Spiral](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language)
> Functional language with intensional polymorphism and first-class staging.
